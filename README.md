# [Birwaz](https://birwaz.co)
Birwaz is a small application that allows users to upload tagged photos and allows
admins to approve photos to be displayed on the site.

The site was created for building Arabic culture oriented photos to be shared
freely and used to display a local face on different products.

You can deploy Birwaz as a Google AppEngine app.

Note: This repo was initiated based on the skeleton repo gae-init-upload. See that repo
for more details on setup of the project.
